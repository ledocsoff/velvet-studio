> AI Model Management & Image Generation Studio — Desktop app for macOS & Windows

Alter is a premium prompt engineering workstation for AI image generation. Manage virtual model profiles, configure detailed scenes, and generate consistent images via Google Gemini — all from a sleek, dark-themed interface.

## Download

| Platform | Download |
|----------|----------|
| **macOS** (Apple Silicon) | [Alter-6.0.0-arm64.dmg](https://github.com/ledocsoff/alter/releases/download/v6.0.0/Alter-6.0.0-arm64.dmg) |
| **Windows** (x64) | [Alter-Setup-6.0.0.exe](https://github.com/ledocsoff/alter/releases/download/v6.0.0/Alter-Setup-6.0.0.exe) |

### 🍏 macOS Installation Guide (Important)
Since Alter is downloaded from GitHub and is not signed by a paid Apple Developer certificate, macOS enforces strict security rules (Gatekeeper and App Translocation). To ensure the app can save your generation data and automatically update itself, please follow these exact steps:
1. Open the downloaded `.dmg` file.
2. **CRITICAL:** Drag and drop the `Alter` icon into the `Applications` folder shortcut right next to it. *Do not launch it directly from the DMG window or your Downloads folder.*
3. Open your Mac's `Applications` folder.
4. **Right-click** (or Control+Click) on the `Alter` app and select **Open**.
5. A security prompt will appear. Click **Open** again to bypass Gatekeeper. 
*(You only need to do this step once. Future launches can be done with a normal double-click).*

> **Windows Users**: Click "More info" → "Run anyway" if Microsoft Defender SmartScreen appears on the first launch.

## Audits & Quality Control

Alter (v6.0.0) has passed a rigorous multi-phase technical audit. Detailed reports covering Cybersecurity, Performance, Accessibility, and Server Integrity are in the `docs/audits/` directory.

## Quick Start (Development)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server (API + Vite)
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

### Electron (Desktop)

```bash
# Dev mode with Electron window
npm run electron:dev

# Build distributable (Mac .dmg / Windows .exe)
npm run electron:build
```

## Releases & CI/CD

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions. To create a new release:

```bash
# Tag and push to trigger the build pipeline
git tag v6.0.0
git push origin v6.0.0
```

The CI pipeline will:
1. Build macOS `.dmg` and Windows `.exe` in parallel
2. Upload both as GitHub Release artifacts
3. Auto-generate release notes from commits

## API Configuration

No `.env` file required — the API key is configured directly in the app via the **API** button in the header. Two key slots (primary + secondary) allow dual-quota management with automatic failover. Keys are stored with base64 obfuscation in localStorage.

## Data Persistence

All data is stored in the `Documents/Alter/sauvegarde/` folder on your computer (Mac or Windows):
- **Safety**: Your data is completely shielded from application updates. Replacing the `.dmg` or `.exe` will **never** overwrite your settings.
- **Backup**: Copy the `Documents/Alter/` folder to a USB drive to preserve everything.
- **Restore**: Paste the `Alter/` folder into your new computer's `Documents` and launch the app.
- **Export/Import**: Use the built-in Export/Import buttons in the UI for quick JSON snapshots.
